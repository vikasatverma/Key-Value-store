# C++ Coding Standards Part 1: Style

Style guidelines are not overly strict. The important thing is that code is clear and readable with an appropriate amount of whitespace and reasonable length lines. A few best practices are also mentioned.

## Descriptive and Consistent Naming

C++ allows for arbitrary length identifier names, so there's no reason to be terse when naming variables. Use descriptive names, and be consistent in the style

 * `CamelCase`
 * `snake_case`
 
are common examples. snake_case has the advantage that it can also work with spell checkers, if desired.

### Common C++ Naming Conventions

 * Types start with capitals: `MyClass`
 * functions and variables start with lower case: `myMethod`
 * constants are all capital: `const int PI=3.14159265358979323;`

*Note that the C++ standard does not follow any of these guidelines. Everything in the standard is lowercase only.*

### Distinguish Private Object Data

Name private data with a `m_` prefix to distinguish it from public data.

### Distinguish Function Parameters

Name function parameters with an `t_` prefix.

### Well formed example

```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass(int t_data)
    : m_data(t_data)
  {
  }
  
  int getData() const
  {
    return m_data;
  }
  
private:
  int m_data;
};
```

## Distinguish C++ Files From C Files

C++ source file should be named `.cpp` or `.cc` NOT `.c`
C++ header files should be named `.hpp` NOT `.h`

## Use `nullptr`

C++11 introduces `nullptr` which is a special type denoting a null pointer value. This should be used instead of 0 or NULL to indicate a null pointer.

## Comments

Comment blocks should use `//`, not `/* */`. Using `//` makes it much easier to comment out a block of code while debugging.

```cpp
// this function does something
int myFunc()
{
}
```

To comment out this function block during debugging we might do:

```cpp
/*
// this function does something
int myFunc()
{
}
*/
```

which would be impossible if the function comment header used `/* */`

## Never Use `using` In a Header File

This causes the name space you are `using` to be pulled into the namespace of the header file.


## Include Guards

Header files must contain an distinctly named include guard to avoid problems with including the same header multiple times or conflicting with other headers from other projects

```cpp
#ifndef MYPROJECT_MYCLASS_HPP
#define MYPROEJCT_MYCLASS_HPP

namespace MyProject {
class MyClass {
};
}

#endif
```

## 2 spaces indent level. 

Tabs are not allowed, and a mixture of tabs and spaces is strictly forbidden. Modern autoindenting IDEs and editors require a consistent standard to be set.

```cpp
// Good Idea
int myFunction(bool t_b)
{
  if (t_b)
  {
    // do something
  }
}
```

## {} are required for blocks. 
Leaving them off can lead to semantic errors in the code.

```cpp
// Bad Idea
// this compiles and does what you want, but can lead to confusing
// errors if close attention is not paid.
for (int i = 0; i < 15; ++i)
  std::cout << i << std::endl;

// Bad Idea
// the cout is not part of the loop in this case even though it appears to be
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 15; ++i)
  ++sum;
  std::cout << i << std::endl;
  
  
// Good Idea
// It's clear which statements are part of the loop (or if block, or whatever)
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 15; ++i) {
  ++sum;
  std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

## Keep lines a reasonable length

```cpp
// Bad Idea
// hard to follow
if (x && y && myFunctionThatReturnsBool() && caseNumber3 && (15 > 12 || 2 < 3)) { 
}

// Good Idea
// Logical grouping, easier to read
if (x && y && myFunctionThatReturnsBool() 
    && caseNumber3 
    && (15 > 12 || 2 < 3)) { 
}
```


## Use "" For Including Local Files
... `<>` is [reserved for system includes](http://blog2.emptycrate.com/content/when-use-include-verses-include).

```cpp
// Bad Idea. Requires extra -I directives to the compiler
// and goes against standards
#include <string>
#include <includes/MyHeader.hpp>

// Worse Idea
// requires potentially even more specific -I directives and 
// makes code more difficult to package and distribute
#include <string>
#include <MyHeader.hpp>


// Good Idea
// requires no extra params and notifies the user that the file
// is a local file
#include <string>
#include "MyHeader.hpp"
```

## Initialize Member Variables
...with the member initializer list

```cpp
// Bad Idea
class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass(int t_value)
  {
    m_value = t_value;
  }

private:
  int m_value;
};


// Good Idea
// C++'s memeber initializer list is unique to the language and leads to
// cleaner code and potential performance gains that other languages cannot 
// match
class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass(int t_value)
    : m_value(t_value)
  {
  }

private:
  int m_value;
};
```

## Forward Declare when Possible

This:
```cpp
// some header file
class MyClass;

void doSomething(const MyClass &);
```

instead of:

```cpp
// some header file
#include "MyClass.hpp"

void doSomething(const MyClass &);
```

This is a proactive approach to simplify compilation time and rebuilding dependencies.

## Always Use Namespaces

There is almost never a reason to declare an identifier in the global namespaces. Instead, functions and classes should exist in an appropriately named namespaces or in a class inside of a namespace. Identifiers which are placed in the global namespace risk conflicting with identifiers from other (mostly C, which doesn't have namespaces) libraries.

## Avoid Compiler Macros

Compiler definitions and macros are replaced by the pre-processor before the compiler is ever run. This can make debugging very difficult because the debugger doesn't know where the source came from.

```cpp
// Good Idea
namespace my_project {
  class Constants {
  public:
    static const double PI = 3.14159;
  }
}

// Bad Idea
#define PI 3.14159;
```
