## Guidelines
0. Use C++ libraries wherever possible.
1. Avoid using stupid variable names like a, b, c, i, etc. Try to use names which will make sense to others while reading no matter how long the name is ie number_of_clients, client_ip, count, flag, etc.
2. No repetitive code. If the code repeats, it means it has an expressable functionality. Declare a function and call that.
3. Add a comment for every function declared informing the reader about its usage and parameters passed.
4. No function should exceed 50 lines of code.
5. Use exception handling if needed and provide proper debugging information.
6. Use proper indentation to allow others to understand the flow of control.
7. Try to follow a naming convention. ie the above variable naming convention is used by python.
